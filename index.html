        Happy birthday, sis. Honestly, it's been such a pleasure to be your "bestie" over the past few months. Isn't it crazy to think that we only started talking to each other more at the end of last year? At first, it felt like only a few months have passed and that we'd known each other for years, but now, we've known each other for over 7 months, and I cannot be any more grateful for you to be in my life. You are truly an incredible person, you know? I understand that sometimes you may look down upon yourself, but trust me, you are much more than anything you've ever said. You have been through so many rough times throughout your life, and no matter how much you comment on yourself being weak, you simply being here still is enough to convince anyone that you're as strong as you can be. Try not to overthink situations too much, and try not to issue all the blame upon yourself. Instead, try to look more on the positive side of things because no matter how intense, difficult, or shameful a situation gets, I'm sure you can always find something to turn everything around, no matter how small it may be. You have wonderful friends by your side at all times, so never be afraid to let us know how you're feeling.
        Of course, it's entirely up to you, as everything is, but I simply want to let you know that we would do as much as we can to make sure that you're okay, even if it means just lending a slight hand to help you back up on your feet. I am proud to call you one of my best friends, and I hope that our friendship will only strengthen with years to come, regardless of necessary changes along the way. Even though I have said this to you countless, it will never be enough to express my gratitude and care for your existence in my life; I love you, and I promise that I will continue to do whatever it takes to stand by you and offer my care for you for what challenges to come next that we must both face.

        Happy birthday cage, I hope you have/had a wonderful day today, and had lots of fun. We haven't talked a lot but I enjoyed that time we watched that movie with Ryan, hopefully soon we'll all do something like that again. I'm told you're turning/have turned 16, remember to make lots of fun memories, you're in the prime of your life.  I hope you know that if you need anything, you can always feel free to contact me and I'll help how I can.  Happy birthday cage,  I hope you have a lot more and I hope that each one is better than the last for you.
    </p>
